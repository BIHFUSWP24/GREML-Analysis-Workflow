MissingOutputException in rule merge_grm in file /sc-projects/sc-proj-dh-ag-eils-ml/workflow/rules/grm.smk, line 59:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/lesi11/testData/test_merged.grm.bin
/home/lesi11/testData/test_merged.grm.N.bin
/home/lesi11/testData/test_merged.grm.id
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
